my name is Hrishik Yendluri and this is my blog and website
the root directory index.html page is the blog, and the static directory contains all of the other content in this site, like project descriptions, games, etc.
the other pages in the root directory are my about page (this one) and my CV/resume page

I made this blog so that I could express my thoughts and hopefully teach something to a couple visitors 
I made the rest of this site so that I can have some sort of official place to document the things I have made
