title: Stack Overflow vs AI
---

I have spent weeks trying to configure 32-bit mode on my bootloader for the operating system, since I am using a custom bootloader rather than GRUB or something else. No matter which AI model I tried, I got no results. I had no choice but to post my question on Stack Overflow. Two days later, I have fixed the bug.

AI will never reach the ingenuity of humans, simply because it just regurgitates what data is fed to it. As GNU says, they truly are just "[bullshit generators](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#bullshit:~:text=%E2%80%9C-,Bullshit%20generators,-%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20suitable)." At least the large language models are.Until we can simulate more than 86 billion neurons, and then manage to feed it all of the knowledge of the world, we will have to rely on ourselves (humans) to fix issues. 

Any rational human being would use AI as a tool rather than as a crutch, yet big corporations push for its usage in companies, and even replace workers with some "smarter" models. Humans are the smartest beings on this planet, and no AI will replace the brilliancy of a person.

The point is that you shouldn't be scared of Stack Overflow. There are people much smarter than AI will ever be on that website.
