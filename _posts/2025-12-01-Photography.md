I got one of my photographs into the Eye on Houston exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts. I like the photograph a lot, but I had to take it with my phone because I didn't have my camera with me. I also had to zoom a lot to get the photograph, which caused it to have low resolution and visual artifacts.
