I got one of my photographs into the Eye on Houston exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts. I like the photograph a lot, but my only gripe with it is that I had to take it with my phone camera rather than a proper one, which caused it to have low resolution and visual artifacts due to the poor quality of it and the fact that I had to zoom a large amount to get the photograph.
