title: Future City 2026
---

This winter break I worked on my team's city model for Future City. Future City is a competition where you design a sustainable and eco-friendly city set 100 years in the future that works around / solves a constraint given for each year's competition. Our city is called Kalira and is set in the center of Cote d'Ivoire within the semicircle-esque curve of the Bandama river above Lake Kossou.
