title: Future City 2026
---

This winter break I worked on my team's city model for Future City. Future City is a competition where you design a sustainable and eco-friendly city set 100 years in the future that works around / solves a constraint given for each year's competition. Our city is called Kalira and is set in the center of Côte d'Ivoire within the semicircle-esque curve of the Bandama river above Lake Kossou. 

To make our model, we used Autodesk Revit because the competition requires that teams use it for their final renders. Since Revit is difficult to work with, I designed all the components of the model in Blender and then ported them into a file format that Revit would accept (.ifc) via the Bonsai extension for Blender. We then imported the .ifc files into Revit, arranged them, and then rendered them. Although Revit is a headache to work with, I think that the renders came out very nicely. Below is one of our renders, a birds-eye view of the city.
