ultrakill prelude port
lsd: revamped port
babbdi port

index more of the site

horror game:
    two monsters, one made of a metal allow other of organic material
    many organics that are weak and one strong alloy
    organic materials can sense you from much farther than alloy
    alloy is like shy guy but with sound
    cars around the map, as well as guns
    molotovs that can hold them back (organic burns to death, alloy gains a red glow)
    neighborhood and facility/prison map
    should be party game style (no annoying horror features)
    roblox esque design (all blocky)
